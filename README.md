# Hinemos Common Project

Hinemos Common source forks from  &lt;https://osdn.net/projects/hinemos/&gt;.

This branch, **grable**, is going to convert this existing project to build using gradle.

```
> gradle build
```
OR
```
> gradle export
```

Then you can replace the original file in the Hinemos lib directory with the newly genearted build/lib/\*.jar
